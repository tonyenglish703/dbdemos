# COMMAND ----------

#Note: we do not recommend to change the catalog here as it won't impact all the demo resources such as DLT pipeline and Dashboards.
#Instead, please re-install the demo with a specific catalog and schema using dbdemos.install("lakehouse-retail-c360", catalog="..", schema="...")

catalog = "main"
schema = dbName = db = "dbdemos_retail_c360"

volume_name = "c360"
